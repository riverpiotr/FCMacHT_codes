The R script Clus_FCMacHT_EnZ.R with source script files mvstats.R and cartware.R allows to replicate the modelling analysis proposed in the manuscript 'Over 200,000 kilometers of free-flowing river habitat is altered due to impoundments in Europe ' by Parasiewicz et al. The necessary data is included in csv files. The source code of the main tools, scripts and algorithms used in this research is available under the GNU General Public License v3.0 at https://github.com/riverpiotr/FCMacHT_codes/blob/main/LICENSE. Other procedures and GIS steps (as described in Methods) were conducted manually and are therefore not part of the code repository.
